What I'd like is:
* Have subcategories of projects, "Highlighted", "Academic", "Personal" and "Misc".
* "Highlighted" has only one project so it's wider, the other categories have two side by side
* Each project is shown like this: 
    An image or gif with the title under it, 
    a status (like "In Development"), 
    a date (and they're ordered by it), 
    tags, 
    and a github button like the one present now but on the far right of it. 
    Also, clicking the image links to another page of the, 
    and hovering over the image shows the first part of the blog page (the "about" section, probably) 

    three buttons optional:
    Github, External Link, Itchio. With corresponding icon (I have them as svg)
        Also, aligned with title
        and Smaller

        Only do the hover (darken image + display text) when hovering over the IMAGE, not the rest of the "project card" ???
        
        Highlighted must take the full width

        the SVG currentColor display as black rather than white?


Change text ("What I do?")
Add things in footer.astro (what's in comments, "made with..")
